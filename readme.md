A project for sharing books firstly, then for the most.


### Note
if you have any questions, please let me know at issues part.

### Start
Start the app with the following steps.

`npm install`

dev:`npm run dev`

prod:`npm run build`

tips:due to the security of chrome limits,we must use the local server to view the effect of the bundle files,so use `node build-server` at terminal to start the server,then open `http://localhost:3001/` in the browser.
